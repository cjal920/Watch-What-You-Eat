# WATCH WHAT YOU EAT
team project - F. Dunigan, C. Larkin, S. Saunders

Much credit for the success of this app belongs to my two collaborators Foster and Sadiki and the work they did resarching the YouTube and TheMealBD APIs, respectively, and writing the code to leverage data from each. A special thanks to them both for their energy and ingenuity. 

Along with first proposing that we do an app that had something to do with food and writing the code for the Firebase component of our code, my major contribution to this work was coming up with the title, writing the copy and designing the UI for it.

WATCH WHAT YOU EAT enables the user to search recipes using any combination of four different search criteria: Dish, Region, Category and Ingredient. The user can then select from any of the dishes their search returns and get a complete recipe along with videos related to the preparation of the selected dish. Finally, the user can store their favorite receipes in the app itself. So because the user is creating, in effect, a menu of their personal culinary specialties, I thought our app should look and feel like a menu too. Bon appetite!
