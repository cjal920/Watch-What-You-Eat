# Watch-What-You-Eat
team project - F. Dunigan, C. Larkin, S. Saunders

Before I get into my contribution to this, my first group project as a coder, I would first like to thank my two collaborators Foster and Sadiki for their contributions to this work. Foster, for his work with the YouTube API, and Sadiki for his deep dive into TheMealDB API and getting all our moving parts of code working together seamlessly. In addition to writing the Firebase component of the code that stored our users' recipes, my biggest contributions to this project were first, in proposing a concept centered around food, and second, the overall UI design.
